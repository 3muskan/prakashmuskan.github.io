user_description: |
  I'm a data scientist in Karlsruhe, Germany.
  Before I went into industry, I obtained a PhD from KIT for deriving insights on the structure of matter from CERN particle collision data.
  I love working with great people, getting creative with data, using state-of-the-art technologies and building awesome products.
  Interested in working together or having a chat? Feel free to contact me.
